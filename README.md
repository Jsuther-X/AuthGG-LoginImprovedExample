# AuthGG---LoginImprovedExample
Featuring 2 Auth.GG Login Examples, Winforms aswell as Console. 

2 Simple AuthGG Examples, one in WindowsForms & one in Console Style. (C#)

They both seem similar to old examples, but due to a lot of requests, I`ve added AutoLogin to both.

The Windowsforms version uses RegistryKeys & to introduce you another way of auto login, IÂ´ve chosen a simple file login for the CUI one, coded by myself.

I hope these repositories help you understand how it works.
